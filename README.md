# BitBond - Liquid Bonds for Bitcoin Holders

## üéØ Overview
BitBond is a DeFi protocol on Stacks that turns fixed-term Bitcoin deposits (sBTC) into liquid, tradeable bond NFTs. Users lock sBTC for 30/90/180 days, earn guaranteed APY, and can sell the bond NFT before maturity on a secondary marketplace.

This makes the Bitcoin economy more capital efficient: idle BTC can earn predictable yield without fully sacrificing liquidity.

## üí° Problem Statement
Bitcoin often sits idle, generating no return. When users do seek yield, they usually give up liquidity (funds locked) or face complex risk profiles. Users want predictable returns and the freedom to exit or reallocate at any time.

## ‚ú® Solution
BitBond issues fixed-term, fixed-yield bond NFTs backed by sBTC. Each bond accrues a guaranteed APY and can be transferred or sold on a marketplace at any time. At maturity, holders redeem principal + yield. Early exits are possible (10% penalty) and feed an insurance pool that strengthens protocol resilience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `bond-vault.clar`: Core vault for creating bonds, tracking lock periods, calculating yields, handling withdrawals at maturity, and early-exit with penalty. Mints/burns bond NFTs and manages the insurance pool.
- `bond-nft.clar`: SIP-009-style NFT contract representing each bond with immutable metadata (amount, APY, lock period, maturity). Restricts transfers to owner or marketplace and provides `get-token-uri` (JSON metadata).
- `bond-marketplace.clar`: Peer-to-peer marketplace for bond NFTs with escrow and atomic swaps. Charges 2% protocol fee on sales (sent to insurance/treasury). Provides read-only price/stats helpers.

### Frontend
- React (Next.js TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS
- Stacks.js integration (`@stacks/connect`, `@stacks/transactions`)
- Wallet connection, bond creation, portfolio, marketplace, analytics
