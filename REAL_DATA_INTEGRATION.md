# üîå Real Data Integration - BitBond Frontend

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Frontend Now Fetches Real Contract Data!

The BitBond frontend has been successfully updated to fetch real data from deployed smart contracts instead of mock data.

---

## üéØ What Changed

### Before:
- Frontend showed demo/mock data by default
- Demo mode was the primary check
- Real contracts were only tried if demo mode was disabled

### After:
- **Frontend attempts real contract calls FIRST**
- Real blockchain data is the primary source
- Demo data only used as fallback when:
  - Contract calls fail (network issues)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` is explicitly set
  - Empty results from contracts (shows proper empty states)

---

## üì¶ Updated Functions in `stacksClient.ts`

All these functions now fetch REAL data from deployed contracts:

### 1. **`getBondInfo(bondId)`**
- Fetches specific bond details from `bond-vault` contract
- Returns bond owner, amount, lock period, APY, status, maturity date
- **Contract Call**: `get-bond` function

### 2. **`getUserBonds(address)`**
- Fetches all bonds owned by a specific wallet address
- Iterates through bond IDs from contract
- **Contract Call**: `get-bond` + `get-next-bond-id`

### 3. **`getAllListings()`**
- Fetches all active marketplace listings
- Gets bond details for each listing
- **Contract Call**: `get-listing` + `get-marketplace-stats`

### 4. **`getListing(bondId)`**
- Fetches specific marketplace listing
- **Contract Call**: `get-listing` function

### 5. **`getProtocolStats()`**
- Fetches protocol-wide statistics
- TVL, total bonds created, average APY, marketplace volume
- **Contract Calls**: `get-protocol-stats` + `get-marketplace-stats`

### 6. **`getMarketplaceStats()`**
- Fetches marketplace-specific statistics
- Total volume, fees, listings, active bonds
- **Contract Call**: `get-marketplace-stats`

---

## üß™ Testing Contract Connectivity

### Test Page Created: `/test-contracts`

A dedicated test page has been created to verify all contract calls:

```
http://localhost:3000/test-contracts
```

**Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Get Protocol Stats
- ‚úÖ Get Marketplace Stats  
- ‚úÖ Get All Listings
- ‚úÖ Get Bond Info

Access this page to:
- Verify contracts are responding
- See raw contract data
- Debug connection issues
- Confirm real data is flowing

---

## üîß Current Contract Status

**Deployed Contracts (Stacks Testnet):**
```
Address: ST12K3B03KFQNFSXSBWEBZG2CE0R75M4GRRJ73S72

Contracts:
- sbtc-token.clar ‚úÖ Deployed
- bond-nft.clar ‚úÖ Deployed
- bond-vault.clar ‚úÖ Deployed  
- bond-marketplace.clar ‚úÖ Deployed
```

**Current State:**
- Contracts are deployed and functional
- Read functions are working
- **No bonds created yet** (empty state is expected)
- When users create bonds, they will appear in real-time

---

## üìä How Data Flows Now

### Dashboard Page:
1. User connects wallet
2. Frontend calls `getUserBonds(userAddress)`
3. **If bonds exist**: Displays real bond cards with live data
4. **If no bonds**: Shows empty state with "Create Your First Bond" button

### Marketplace Page:
1. Frontend calls `getAllListings()`
2. **If listings exist**: Shows marketplace cards with real prices/data
3. **If no listings**: Shows empty state "No bonds listed for sale"

### Analytics Page:
1. Frontend calls `getProtocolStats()`
2. **If contracts have data**: Shows real TVL, bond count, APY, etc.
3. **If contracts empty**: Shows zeros or default values

---

## üé® Empty State Handling

The app now gracefully handles empty contract states:

### When No Bonds Exist:
```typescript
// Returns empty array from contract
const bonds = await stacksClient.getUserBonds(address)
// bonds = []

// UI shows:
// "No bonds yet. Create your first bond to get started!"
```

### When No Listings Exist:
```typescript
const listings = await stacksClient.getAllListings()
// listings = []

// UI shows:
// "No bonds listed for sale. Check back later!"
```

### When Contracts Return Zero Stats:
```typescript
const stats = await stacksClient.getProtocolStats()
// stats = { totalBonds: 0, tvl: 0, ... }

// UI shows:
// "Protocol statistics will appear once bonds are created"
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Users to See Real Data:

1. **Create Bonds**:
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Create Bond tab
   - Fill in amount and lock period
   - Submit transaction
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Bond appears in portfolio!

2. **List Bonds on Marketplace**:
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí My Bonds
   - Click "List for Sale" on a bond
   - Set price in STX
   - Confirm transaction
   - Listing appears in marketplace!

3. **Buy Bonds**:
   - Go to Marketplace
   - Browse available bonds
   - Click "Buy Now"
   - Confirm transaction
   - Bond transfers to your wallet!

## üîç Debugging Contract Calls

### Check Console Logs:
The app logs all contract interactions:

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// You'll see:
console.log('Fetching protocol stats from contracts...', { contract })
console.log('Raw contract responses:', { data })
console.log('Returning real contract stats:', stats)
```

### If Contract Calls Fail:
1. Check network (testnet vs mainnet)
2. Verify contract addresses in `.env.local`
3. Test with `/test-contracts` page
4. Check Stacks API status: https://api.testnet.hiro.so/

### If Data Shows Zeros:
- **This is normal!** Contracts are empty until users create bonds
- Not a bug, just an empty state
- Create a test bond to verify everything works

---

## üìù Environment Configuration

### `.env.local` Settings:
```bash
# Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_API_URL=https://api.testnet.hiro.so

# Contract Addresses
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=ST12K3B03KFQNFSXSBWEBZG2CE0R75M4GRRJ73S72
NEXT_PUBLIC_SBTC_CONTRACT=ST12K3B03KFQNFSXSBWEBZG2CE0R75M4GRRJ73S72.sbtc-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOND_VAULT_CONTRACT=ST12K3B03KFQNFSXSBWEBZG2CE0R75M4GRRJ73S72.bond-vault
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOND_MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT=ST12K3B03KFQNFSXSBWEBZG2CE0R75M4GRRJ73S72.bond-marketplace
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOND_NFT_CONTRACT=ST12K3B03KFQNFSXSBWEBZG2CE0R75M4GRRJ73S72.bond-nft

# Demo Mode (set to false for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false
```

3. Bond shows real APY, maturity date, current value ‚úÖ

### After Listing a Bond:
